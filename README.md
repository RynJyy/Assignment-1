Real-Time Face Verification using DeepFace

This Python program captures live video from a webcam and performs real-time face verification** using the DeepFace library. It compares each detected face with a reference image and displays whether there is a match or no match. The program runs face verification asynchronously every few frames to ensure smooth performance.

Package Used:
- opencv-python
- deepface

Features:
- Uses OpenCV for video capture and display.
- Implements DeepFace for face recognition.
- Utilizes multithreading for non-blocking processing.
- Displays real-time match status on the video feed.
